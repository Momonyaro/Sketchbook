So this is Sebastian Lague's Path Creator tool that is available for free via the Unity Asset
Store or GitHub. From looking at this and what we could make in a short time-frame I decided that
we could instead use this and modify it to our exact specs.

Please talk to me if you have further questions, otherwise you don't have to thing about
this since the license makes this "our" version of Path Creator if we modify the code.
